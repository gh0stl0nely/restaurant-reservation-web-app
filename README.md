# Restaurant Reservation Application

A simple back-end web application for table reservation at a restaurant

## Project Description

The restaurant manager can reserve a table for users by making reservations. 

Once five tables are occupied (reserved), any additional reservations made will be added to Reservation (a.k.a waitlist)

Once the user finishes using a table, the admin can go to "view table" and remove it from the occupied table list. 

The first reservation on the reservation/waitlist will be automatically added to the occupied table list
